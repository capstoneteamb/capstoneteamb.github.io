            <p>
                A web app designed to help with the PSU Capstone classes.
                At minimum, it will help with the 360 review process.
                At best, it will help with Capstone team lead and team management as well.
                The web app is to be hosted on a a stock Linux installation using
                Apache2 or Nginx, will use Postgres as the database, and will be written
                in Python. Security is a high priority, and must be built in from the ground up.

                    <h4><b>Sprint 1: 3/15/2019 to 4/16/2019 (spring break not included)</b></h4>
                    <p>In our first sprint, we set out to accomplish a first round of user stories (which optimistically encompassed over half of the minimum viable product). When the original end date of the sprint came, we had team members who had their individual stories’ tasks completed, but the project was not in one cohesive application. We thus were not finished, and our team had concluded two things. First, we realized that we had not taken the necessary time to finalize the overall organization of the project, so extra work would be need to be done to merge the changes for all of the user stories we were working on. Secondly, with some additional security research during the sprint and subsequent discussion, we decided to implement the SQLAlchemy library into our code. At this point, we extended our sprint by one week.</p>
                    <p>As the new deadline passed, we still found that we weren’t done. SQLAlchemy was proving difficult to incorporate into our code, and it would require significant re-development of our stories. At this point, we reflected on our sprint, and on some of the things we could do better. Chief among these were being more communicative with one another and spending more time planning our organization as a team. Instead of ending the sprint there however, we decided to extend the sprint to our next meeting and focus our efforts on trying to get our code completed (without SQLAlchemy--that part could wait) and merged so we would have something to present to our sponsor (because we arranged a demonstration on that day).</p>
                    <p>When that day came, we still weren’t finished (not even with what we wanted to have done by that time, though some things had gotten checked in), but proceeded to demonstrate what functionality our application had (on the main and on some of the development branches of our GitHub repo). Even as someone familiar with the Capstone process, our sponsor seemed to be very pleased with the amount of work we had been able to accomplish. While he stated that there were changes he wished to have made, he stressed that these were minor in comparison to our achievement thus far. After finishing, we extended our sprint one more time (officially making it four weeks long).</p>
                    <p>By the time that time came, most of us had accomplished all or most, of the tasks we needed to complete our user stories, some simply waiting for peer review (which we made required if the changes want to make it into the main branch). We still couldn’t call anything done however, since we determined that we would only call a user story done once it made its way into the master branch in its finalized state.</p>
                    <p>There was one user story we weren’t close to finishing, however: one about setting our log-in system up, but there were external factors were at play; namely, the cooperation of other people. Initially, we decided to use the ODIN login system, and thus relied on the cooperation of OIT. While we received an initial, affirmative response from them, they stopped responding to our emails. We ended up giving up on ODIN and shot for the CAT supported CAS log in system instead. They also responded in the affirmative, and thankfully, continued communicating with us. They recently provided us the information we will need to implement the log in system as well. Even with the information, we were still left with about a sprint’s worth of time to work on it, though I don’t think anyone jumped on the information and started working on it when everyone in the team became aware of it (misconception, miscommunication, lack of communication, or lack of proper team management, could have been a part of this). It might also be worth mentioning that in order to use the CAT’s CAS system, we needed the CAT to finish setting up a virtual machine for us (one that will host our application in the foreseeable future), and that only got set up recently (we could have, of course, tried setting up our own CAS server, but even if we did, it wouldn’t have been a permanent solution and we may not have marked the user story as completed anyway).</p>
                    <p>Overall, while we didn’t get any user stories done, we were certainly worked in these four weeks, and if the witness of our sponsor means anything, we seemed to get a good amount done. We will aim to avoid four week sprints in the future. Thank you for your time!</p>
