            <p>
                A web app designed to help with the PSU Capstone classes.
                At minimum, it will help with the 360 review process.
                At best, it will help with Capstone team lead and team management as well.
                The web app is to be hosted on a a stock Linux installation using
                Apache2 or Nginx, will use Postgres as the database, and will be written
                in Python. Security is a high priority, and must be built in from the ground up.

                    <h4><b>Sprint 1: 3/15/2019 to 4/16/2019 (spring break not included)</b></h4>
                    <p>In our first sprint, we set out to accomplish a first round of user stories (which encompassed over half of the minimum viable product). When the original end date of the sprint came, we weren't finished. We had some team members who had their individual stories’ tasks completed, but the project was not in one cohesive application. At that point we realized that we had not taken the necessary time to finalize the overall organization of the project, so extra work would be need to be done to merge the changes for all of the user stories we were working on. With some additional security research during the sprint and subsequent discussion, we decided to implement the SQLAlchemy library into our code as well. We then point extended our sprint by one week.</p>
                    <p>As the new deadline came, we found that we still weren’t done. SQLAlchemy was proving difficult to incorporate into our code, require significant re-development of our code. We then reflected on our sprint, and on some of the things we could do better. Chief among these were being more communicative with one another and spending more time planning our organization as a team. Instead of ending the sprint there, we decided to extend it to our next meeting and focus our efforts on trying to get our code conpleted (without SQLAlchemy--that part could wait) and merged so we would have something to present to our sponsor (because we arranged a demonstration for that day).</p>
                    <p>When that day came, we still weren’t finished, but proceeded to demonstrate what functionality our application had (on the main and on some of the development branches of our GitHub repo). Even as someone familiar with the Capstone process, our sponsor seemed to be very pleased with the amount of work we had been able to accomplish. While he stated that there were changes he wished to have made, he stressed that these were minor in comparison to our achievement thus far. After finishing, we extended our sprint one more time (officially making it four weeks long).</p>
                    <p>At the final end of the sprint, we had user stories that were close to being done (one, very close), but we still couldn’t call any of them done. We decided that we would only call a user story done if it made its way into the master branch in its finalized state, and rather unfortunately, none of them did. That said, we still made a fair bit of progress on most of those user stories.</p>
                    <p>The two (very closely related) user stories we didn't make a lot of progress on were ones relating to our app's login system. External factors, namely, the cooperation of other people, were at play however. Initially, we decided to use the ODIN login system, and thus relied on the cooperation of OIT. While we received an initial, affirmative response from them, they stopped responding to our emails. We ended up giving up on ODIN and shot for the CAT supported CAS log in system instead. They also responded in the affirmative, and thankfully, continued communicating with us. They also provided us the information we needed to implement the log in system as well, but by the time they got us the information, we only had about a week left to work on the stories. That said, we still could have jumped on the information and started trying to work right then and there, but unfortunately, I don't think any of us did (misconception, miscommunication, lack of communication, or lack of proper team management, could have been a part of the reason why this didn't happen). It might also be worth mentioning that in order to use the CAT’s CAS system, we needed the CAT to finish setting up a virtual machine for us (one that will host our application in the foreseeable future), and that only got set up recently (relative to the time the content of this paragraph was originally written). We theoretically could have tried setting up our own CAS server, or bypassed the server temporarily, but even if we did, it wouldn’t have been a permanent solution and we may not have marked the user story as completed anyway.</p>
                    <p>Overall, while we didn't officially finish any of our user stories, we still might have gotten a decent amount of work done (especially if the witness of our sponsor means anything). It might also be fair to say that if SQLAlchemy hadn't given us as much grief as it did, we might have been at least a little but further along. In the future, we might consider more conservative planning, and we will aim to avoid four week sprints. Thank you for your time!<p>
                    <p>------------------------------</p>
                    <p>User Stories Completed: None (though we got kind of close to finishing some of them) -- see Trello board snapshot to get an idea of what those were. In our case, the ones that look like "(100) *text* []" are user stories. We added some non-user stories to our Trello board at some point in the sprint. These don't have numbers in parentheses and brackets around them.</p>
                    <p>User Stories Left: See (non-snapshot) Trello board (we also added some non-user story tasks, but gave them user story points this time)</p>
